     * Given how the SDK and game have no direct connection, 
     * unregistering and registering every action individually every time the game 'phase' changes would be a pain.
     * Instead, we create ActionScenes, which contain all the possible Actions possible in a given situation,
     * then, we can just initialize and clean up that so phase changes can be done in one simple command
     * and the game can't register commands at a time it wouldn't work. 
     * Note that despite the name, these are not one-to-one with the current Unity Scene! 
     * A single Scene may contain several ActionScenes if they possess several distinct phases with incompatible commands,
     * or multiple versions of an ActionScene could be used in the same Scene to provide small changes
     * (e.g., all of the Core Suppressions compared to their base class, FacilityManagementScene).
